# Copy this file to `.env` (for local overrides) or use your CI/CD secret management.

# Base API URL used by the frontend to check if the server is still alive. (will upgrade to /status and use /contact for submissions.)
# ./contact will receive post requests
# In development this should point at my local backend (e.g., http://localhost:5000)
# In production it should point to your deployed API host (e.g., https://catfact.ninja/fact)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Optional: explicitly set the mode (not required when using Vite's import.meta.env.MODE)
# VITE_MODE=development

# Notes:
# - Prefix client-visible variables with VITE_ so Vite will expose them to the browser.
# - Keep secrets (API keys, DB credentials) out of client env files; use a backend or secure secret storage.
# - For CI/CD, set the equivalent variables as pipeline/host secrets instead of committing them.

# Set time before get request to API is made (in ms obviously)
VITE_DELAY=60000
